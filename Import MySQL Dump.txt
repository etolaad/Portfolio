To import relations (tables with relationships) into MySQL using the command line, follow these steps:

1. Prepare Your SQL Dump File
Ensure you have a `.sql` file that contains:
- `CREATE TABLE` statements (including foreign key constraints).
- `INSERT INTO` statements (to populate data).

2. Open MySQL Command Line
Log into MySQL using the command line:

sh
mysql -u your_username -p


Enter your password when prompted.

3. Create the Database (If Not Exists)
If the database isn't created yet, do it manually:

sql
CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
USE your_database_name;


4. Import the SQL File
Exit MySQL and use the following command in the terminal:

sh
mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < your_sql_file.sql


This will import all table definitions and relationships.

5. Verify the Import
After importing, log into MySQL again and check:

sql
SHOW TABLES;


To inspect foreign key constraints:

sql
SELECT TABLE_NAME, CONSTRAINT_NAME, REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME
FROM information_schema.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE
WHERE REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME IS NOT NULL;
